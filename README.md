Overview:

This project is a News Aggregator that fetches real-time news updates from ThePrint website and displays them on a user-friendly webpage. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js, Express.js, Cheerio, and Axios for the backend web scraping functionality.

Code Explanation:

Backend (server.js):

Uses Axios to fetch the HTML content from ThePrint.
Cheerio parses and extracts news articles (title, link, image).
Express.js serves the scraped data as a JSON API at /news endpoint.

Frontend (index.html, styles.css, script.js):

Fetches news data from http://localhost:5000/news.
Displays the news articles dynamically in Bootstrap cards.
Uses JavaScript (fetch API) to update content in real-time.
Troubleshooting

Backend not working? :

Ensure Node.js is installed.
Run npm install to check dependencies.
Check for errors in the console (node server.js).

Frontend not displaying news? :

Open browser console (F12 > Console) for errors.
Ensure backend server is running before opening index.html.

Future Enhancements:

Implement a search filter for news.
Add pagination for better navigation.
Improve UI design with animations.
